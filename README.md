# track-and-map-workouts

This is a workout tracker web app built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to log workouts and track their progress using local storage.

### Credit
This project is based on the Udemy course **The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!** by **Jonas Schmedtmann**.  
I followed the course to build the foundation but plan to expand it with additional features:
 
 * Ability to edit a workout
 * Ability to delete a workout
 * Ability to delete all workouts
 * Ability to sort workouts by a certain field (ex: distance)
 * Rebuild Running and Cycling objects coming from Local Storage
